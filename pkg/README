README      David Xiao      2010-1-24

    All BQResult, Connection, and Result methods have been implimented minus
        most who were designated optional by the DBI vignette on CRAN.

    Pass-by-value problems have now been fixed - dbCloseResult, dbDisconnect,
        dbListConnections, etc. now function as they should.

    Next version will be documentation, and will probably be release before or
        right before 1.0.

First version now mostly complete and usable, bumping to version 0.5

README      David Xiao      2010-1-21

    Fixed bug which returned bad query results.

    Implimented dbListFields, created new function bqDescribeTables which gives
        table metadata, will be replaced with BQConnect S4 method soon.

    driver registry issues will be shelved indefinitely - I might implement
        registry of results by the connections though

    At least while this package is version<=1.0, it will have read capability
        only - unless someone wants to help me...

Bumping version number to 0.4


README      David Xiao      2011-1-13

    BQResult has now been fully implemented, with the exception of
        dbClearResult. As long as your query does no exceed the data limit
        of a single BigQuery query, you should be able to get everything
        you need.

    Next update will either try to implement the convenience classes for
        dbConnect or expand BQResult to be able to deal with arbitrarily
        large result sets.

    Another idea is to provide auth cookie loading and saving.

Overall status: 1/3 to 1.0

README      David Xiao      2011-1-01

Currently writing first test build:

    You can now login and make queries to the BigQuery database. Most of the
        functions are not yet implemented and a few that are have major
        bugs (see note below), but a basic work cycle is now ok.

    Next update will implement the major methods of BQResult

    Major problem for future updates is dealing with R's pass-by-value system -
        driver's registry of connections doesn't yet work.

Overall status: Package now rudimentarily usable.

README      David Xiao      2010-12-14

Currently writing first test build:

    RBigQuery.R is mostly commented out for the sake of actually being able to test
        the package. Only the Driver class is implemented (and only partially
        at that).

    dbObjectId.R for the most part is abandoned - if I need it later, it's there

    RBigQuerySupport.R is mostly discarded - design decision based on the fact that
        this package's engine is in RCurl and rjson, not in a native C 
        implementation

Overall status: Code seems far more regresed, but now loads as a library

README      David Xiao      2010-12-7

Currently writing first test build:

    RBigQuery.R is largely done - if it's discovered that most of code is already
        written by predeccessors, I might expand the interface to cover the optional
        methods given in DBI specs.

    dbObjectId.R is mostly untouched - one little C call which I need to look at

    RBigQuerySupport.R is not even close - it's mostly just copied over RMySQL code
        that I haven't even gotten to renaming yet. Three major phases here: rename
        all the methods, bring the c-code into R, and then write in the RCurl/JSON

Overall status: If anything even so much as compiles right now, your compiler is
    broken.
