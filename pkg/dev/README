Currently writing first test build:

    RBigQuery.R is largely done - if it's discovered that most of code is already
        written by predeccessors, I might expand the interface to cover the optional
        methods given in DBI specs.

    dbObjectId.R is mostly untouched - one little C call which I need to look at

    RBigQuerySupport.R is not even close - it's mostly just copied over RMySQL code
        that I haven't even gotten to renaming yet. Three major phases here: rename
        all the methods, bring the c-code into R, and then write in the RCurl/JSON

Overall status: If anything even so much as compiles right now, your compiler is
    broken.
