Currently writing first test build:

    RBigQuery.R is mostly commented out for the sake of actually being able to test
        the package. Only the Driver class is implemented (and only partially
        at that).

    dbObjectId.R for the most part is abandoned - if I need it later, it's there

    RBigQuerySupport.R is mostly discarded - design decision based on the fact that
        this package's engine is in RCurl and rjson, not in a native C 
        implementation

Overall status: Code seems far more regresed, but now loads as a library

README      David Xiao      2010-12-7

Currently writing first test build:

    RBigQuery.R is largely done - if it's discovered that most of code is already
        written by predeccessors, I might expand the interface to cover the optional
        methods given in DBI specs.

    dbObjectId.R is mostly untouched - one little C call which I need to look at

    RBigQuerySupport.R is not even close - it's mostly just copied over RMySQL code
        that I haven't even gotten to renaming yet. Three major phases here: rename
        all the methods, bring the c-code into R, and then write in the RCurl/JSON

Overall status: If anything even so much as compiles right now, your compiler is
    broken.
